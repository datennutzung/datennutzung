# 👋 🌍

## Hello and welcome to my GitHub Repository

This is where I upload and (sometimes) maintain some personal and work projects, mostly built with HTML and JavaScript, because of Github Pages, though some of the things I do are also built with Python or other languages.

Since these are mostly personal projects, they are not built to work with anyone elses systems but my own, and fix "problems" no one else but me might have, so be weary.
